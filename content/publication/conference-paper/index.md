abstract: In the era of industrial big data, the demand for high-speed data
  transmission is higher and higher. The traditional Modbus protocol uses fixed
  data frame length transmission, which can not make full use of link resources,
  resulting in very low transmission rate. In the early stage, in order to solve
  the problem of traditional ModBus transmission protocol, an algorithm was
  proposed to adjust the frame length by calculating the optimal frame length
  through the frame error rate. However, because the frame length of each data
  frame is adjusted in this algorithm, the link stability becomes worse and the
  efficiency is reduced. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an
  improved adaptive frame length adjustment algorithm, which adjusts the frame
  length according to the retransmission failure rate per unit time, and gives
  different adjustment schemes according to different situations, which improves
  the link stability. Finally, this paper takes the servo drive data acquisition
  system as the carrier, and verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm through
  experiments.
